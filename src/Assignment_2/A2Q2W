if(karel.canPickThing())                                    
{                                                        
    karel.turnRight();                               
} else {                                                   
    karel.turnLeft();                                
}  



Statement 2
if(!karel.canPickThing())
{                                                                          
    karel.turnLeft();
} else {                                                                                                                          
    karel.turnRight();
}   


They are the same because the first statement states that if the condition is 
true karel turns right and if its is false karel turns left. The second 
statement states the opposite, if it is false turn left and if it is true turn 
right.
